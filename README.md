Yeah!

Hi GitHub! This is cool! My name is Moses613, and I'm a CS student in Lander College for Men. I like music, Japanese stuff, and teaching math at Mathnasium. I just started at freeCodeCamp, and they're pretty cool. I'm trying to participate in Hacktoberfest, despite my beginner-hood, so here we go!
